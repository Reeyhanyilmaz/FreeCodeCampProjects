                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                    structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example:   
                </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.  
        </li>
    </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello World</header> 
            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World"); 
                </code> 
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </article>
        </section>  <!-- Hello World section End -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). 
            </p>

            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.
            </p>

            <header> Constants </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                    syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.  
                </p>

                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>

                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                    variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                    represent a variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example: 
                </p>

                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                    } 
                </code>

                <code>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                    is executed without problems.     
                </code>

                <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";

            <article>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:   
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Boolean. true and false.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                            is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                            other variant.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Number. 42 or 3.14159.
                        </li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                            Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                            unique and immutable. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

            <header>Function Declarations</header>
            <article>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
          separated by commas. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                        brackets, { }.   
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:    
            </p>
            <code>
                function square(number) { return number * number; }      
            </code>

            <p>
                The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                specifies the value returned by the function.   
            </p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>
                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
        value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
        the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
        the calling function.    
            </p>
